[2026-01-10 02:10:00] Found root cause: DUPLICATE HOOKS - both settings.local.json AND plugin hooks.json defining same hooks
[2026-01-10 02:10:10] Fix: Removed hooks from settings.local.json, keep only plugin hooks
[2026-01-10 02:10:20] Created self-contained VBS scripts (no cmd.exe args needed):
  - .claude/plugins/task/scripts/precompact-hidden.vbs
  - .claude/plugins/task/scripts/stop-hidden.vbs
[2026-01-10 02:10:30] Updated plugin hooks.json to use self-contained VBS scripts
